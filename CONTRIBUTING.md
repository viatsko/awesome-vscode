# Contributing Guidelines

To submit a package to this list, please do the following:

1. Find a link to the package you consider is awesome. Use the link from [marketplace.visualstudio.com](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) instead of a link from its GitHub repository.
2. Find the appropriate place for your package. If it belongs to a certain section, put it there. If it doesn't belong to a specific category, you should put it in the `uncategorized` section. Make sure to put your package in the alphabetical odrer.
3. If possible, find a `.gif` animation that displays the functionality of the package.

Submit your package in the specific form:

```gfm
#### [Title of the package](https://s3.amazonaws.com/extend.brackets/NAME/NAME-VERSION.zip)
> A short description of what this package does and why is it awesome.

![title of the package](link to the .gif file that explains its functionality)
```

Failure of complying to these contributing guidelines will result in your pull request being rejected.
